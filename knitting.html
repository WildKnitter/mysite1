<h1>Knitting is the New Yoga--NOT</h1>
<p>There is a common misconception that my favorite hobby knitting is <q>The New Yoga</q>.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever struggled with the kitchner stitch, has pounded their head against a wall attempting to modify a pattern that clearly was written by someone who can't add 2 + 2, or has stayed up all Christmas Eve to feverishly finish a major present that JUST ISN'T DONE YET--would beg to differ.</p>
