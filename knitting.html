<h1>Knitting is the New Yoga--NOT</h1>

<p>There is a common misconception that my favorite hobby knitting is <q id="yoga">The New Yoga.</q></p>
<p>Anyone who has EVER:
    <ul>
        <li>struggled with the kitchner stitch</li>
        <li>pounded their head against a wall attempting to modify a pattern that clearly was written by someone who can't add 2 + 2</li>
        <li>stayed up all Christmas Eve to feverishly finish a major present that JUST ISN'T DONE YET</li>
    </ul>
    would beg to differ.</p>
